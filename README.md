# Work Day Planner
## Project Description:
* This is a simple day planner application that allows the user to input their events/appointments into the time blocks and save them to be viewed again later. To be specific, this DayPlanner application uses the Moment.js library and jQuery to display the current date and time, as well as to determine and display which time-blocks are in the past, present, or future. This application, also through jQuery, employs local storage, allowing the user to save their events for future viewing.
* Upon opening the application, the user will see the current date and time at the top of the page. Further down, the user will see a series of time-blocks from 9AM to 5PM (a typical work day). The user is able to click the center (color-coded) section of the time-block row and type in their event to they want to schedule. After this, the user just needs to click the save button on the right, and the event can be viewed again later on, even if the browser has been closed and re-opened.
